# Why

I wanted to send a push notification to myself whenever a sensor changes (ie, whenever a door opens or motion is detected).

I wanted the push notification to have the name and room of the device that triggered it. I thought about doing this manually with variables and macros but it seemed like a lot more work than writing a driver.

# How

1. Install the driver. 

2. Select any motion sensors you want to watch here in Watch Devices.

3. Connect any contact sensors you want to monitor in here:

4. In programming, under "Triggered" you can do whatever you want. I send a push notification.

5. In push notifications you can use the "Add Variable" to add extra text from the Holiday Mode device.
